# Vessel Clipper
Clip vessel surface with user input centerlines. This repository is a GUI version of the [Vessel Centerline Extraction](https://github.com/jackyko1991/Vessel-Centerline-Extraction). Extra functions like surface clipping, domain defining are also included for CFD and morphological analysis purposes.

## Features
- Centerline and geometry calculation
- Clip user input vessel surfaces (.VTK, .VTP, .STL) with pre-defined centerline file (.VTP, .VTK).
- Clipped surface enclosing (capping)
- Output domain for CFD region definitions.

## Example Usages
### Centerline Calculation
### Surface Clipping
### Boundary Extension
### Domain Define for CFD simulation

## Pre-build binary

## Build from Source

### Known issue
#### itkdouble-conversion

## To-do List
- Add cylindrical clipper
- Boundary extension
- Fiducial points
